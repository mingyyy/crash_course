8-14. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary .
The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name .
It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments .
Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature .
Your function should work for a call like this one:
                  car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)
Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly .
